The Young Person's Matched Administrative Dataset (YPMAD) brings together a range of education datasets, primarily to calculate measures of attainment in qualifications at level 3 and below at each age from 16 upwards.

This involves pooling data from KS4, KS5, [[School Census]] and ILR datasets.

l1_overall
l2_overall
l3_overall

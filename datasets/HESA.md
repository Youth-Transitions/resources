The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Student Record provides data on student enrolments and achievements within the Higher Education sector.

Most students recorded in the HESA dataset are in higher education (NQF level 4 or above) although there is a small number in further education (NQF level 3 and below).

Unlike other education datasets in LEO, providers in the UK outside England are included.

The example script uses fields related to the qualifications for which students are enrolled (and also those which they achieve), including dates, subjects, mode of study.

We do not include any data relating to pupil characteristics although these are available (on request) to researchers working with LEO. This includes parental education and socio-economic classification.

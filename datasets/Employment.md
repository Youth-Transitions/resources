The source data is probably the simplest dataset to work with in LEO, consisting solely of dates during which individuals were employed.

Data is sourced from HMRC systems. This was historically based on P45 returns but, starting in 2013/14, began to be based on Real Time Information (RTI).

We do not perform any further processing of the source LEO data beyond adding our person identifier (fft_person_id).

PLAMS is a collection of post-16 (post-compulsory) learning aims studied by students in schools.

It was designed to be analogous to the ILR [[Aims]] dataset, although limited to the subset of variables related to which qualifications were being studied and when.

Data on learning aims being studied is collected each year as part of October [[School Census]].

Learning aims are matched to subsequent results collected from awarding bodies. Grades will be present where a learning aim has been matched to a result.

In some cases, learning aim records have been injected into PLAMS from results data where they did not previously exist (i.e. they were missing in School Census learning aims data submissions).
